# Python: Tuples

## What are tuples?
* they are __ordered__ collections of items, similar to lists, but they are immutable.
    * Immutable --> means that they are __NOT CHANGEABLE__ once created. 
    * once you put something in you can't change it. 
* we use brackets - __( )__ - to declare a tuple
        (100, "hello world", 10.358)

Why do we use tuples:
* they are faster to create and use less computer memory
* Tuples are like a sealed package, while lists are like a bag you can keep adding or removing things from. 
* you can return multiple values more easily with tuples (for loops and functions)
